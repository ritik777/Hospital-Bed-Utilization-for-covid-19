# Interactive Revolving hospital bed and icu Utilization aiding Air Route for Covid-19 Emergency
## Introduction and motivation of the problem
One of the challenges that Covid-19 hit us is with limited bed and icu beds in the hospitals with the outbreak progressing exponentially.

I came up with this idea to create a story that presents one of the ways to manage hospital beds using helicopters situated at hospital.

## Description
This user interactive project aims to analyze hospital capacity in united states when the coronavirus patients reach 20% of the population by state. 

A Regression model is built on bed capacity and offers localized estimate of beds that would be needed in the coming months.

The model assesses hospital capacity over six, twelve, and eighteen months, if 20%, 40%, or 60% of the population contracts COVID-19
For more information on methodology and how rates are calculated, see:Â https://globalepidemics.org/our-data-guide/

## Audience
audience can be anything ranging from hospital parties to the state government, therefore this project is developed from their standpoint which helps them take necessary action.

## Approach ( Story Creation)
Created 4 stories that leads to another and at the end giving the solution of the problem. Please refer to powerpoint or dashboard for more Clarity

## Story 1 : Shows Hospital Beds with respect to Available adult and 65+ population

## Story 2: Hospital Bed Capacity Analysis when 20 percent of the population, which seems plausible in the near future get affected.

## Story 3: Hospital and ICU Availability Analysis under high impacted states from Story 2.

## Story 4 : Hospital Search in Each State to manage availability

## Data 
Ingested 3 different datafiles at different places. including hospital capacity data, covid 19 affected individual prediction data, Helipad data at hospitals.
